# 2.1 What is Pages?

GitHub Pages is a feature provided by GitHub that allows you to create and host static websites directly from your GitHub repositories. It's designed to make it easy for developers, project managers, and individuals to share their code, documentation, or personal projects with a broader audience on the web.

Here are the key points about GitHub Pages:

1. **Static Websites**: GitHub Pages hosts static websites, which means the content is pre-rendered and doesn't rely on server-side processing or databases. These websites are typically faster to load and are well-suited for displaying content that doesn't frequently change, such as documentation, portfolios, blogs, and project landing pages.

2. **GitHub Repository Integration**: GitHub Pages is tightly integrated with your GitHub repositories. You can create a dedicated branch (often called `gh-pages` or `main` for user and organization sites) or use the `docs` folder in your repository to store the source code for your website.

3. **Markdown Support**: You can write your website content in Markdown, a lightweight markup language, which makes it easy to create well-formatted text without dealing with complex HTML.

4. **Custom Domains**: GitHub Pages allows you to use a custom domain (like www.example.com) for your website, giving it a professional look and aligning it with your branding.

5. **Jekyll Integration**: While not required, GitHub Pages works seamlessly with Jekyll, a static site generator. Jekyll can transform your plain text content into a fully-functional website with themes, layouts, and other customization options.

6. **Automatic Deployment**: GitHub Pages can automatically build and deploy your site whenever you push changes to your repository. This eliminates the need for manual updates and ensures that your website is always up-to-date.

7. **Public or Private**: You can choose to make your GitHub Pages site public, accessible to anyone, or private, limited to specific collaborators.

8. **Project Pages and User/Organization Pages**: GitHub Pages offers two main categories: Project Pages and User/Organization Pages. Project Pages are associated with specific repositories and are hosted under a subpath (e.g., `username.github.io/repository`). User/Organization Pages have a dedicated repository named after your GitHub username or organization name and are hosted at the root level (e.g., `username.github.io`).

9. **Versatile Use Cases**: GitHub Pages is used for a wide range of purposes, including hosting documentation for software projects, sharing personal blogs, building portfolios, creating landing pages for open-source projects, and much more.

Overall, GitHub Pages provides an accessible and convenient way to publish web content directly from your repositories, allowing you to showcase your work and ideas without the complexities of traditional web hosting.
